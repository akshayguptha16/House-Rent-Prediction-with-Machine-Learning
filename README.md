# House Rent Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting house rent prices using various machine learning algorithms.  
It helps understand the key factors that affect house rent, such as location, size, number of rooms, furnishing status, and other property features.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house rent based on given features.  
By analyzing historical rental data, the model provides insights into how different factors influence rent prices.

## 🧠 Objective

- Analyze housing data to identify important variables affecting rent  
- Train and test machine learning models for rent prediction  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R² score  

## 🗂️ Dataset
